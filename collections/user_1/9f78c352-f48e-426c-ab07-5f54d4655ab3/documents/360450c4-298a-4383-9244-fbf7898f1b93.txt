[0.0s-6.2s] Hello everyone, thank you guys for coming to our weekly student success meeting and let's just get started.
[6.6s-11.4s] So I have our list of chronically absent students here and I've been noticing a troubling trend.
[12.3s-16.4s] A lot of students are skipping on Fridays. Does anyone have any idea what's going on?
[17.3s-21.0s] I've heard some of my mentees talking about how it's really hard to get out of bed on Fridays.
[21.6s-25.4s] It might be good if we did something like a pancake breakfast to encourage them to come.
[26.1s-28.8s] I think that's a great idea. Let's try that next week.
[29.9s-34.2s] It might also be because a lot of students have been getting sick now that it's getting colder outside.
[34.6s-38.0s] I've had a number of students come by my office with symptoms like sniffling and coughing.
[38.5s-41.8s] We should put up posters with tips for not getting sick since it's almost flu season.
[42.0s-44.3s] Like, you know, wash your hands after the bathroom. Stuff like that.
[44.8s-49.0s] I think that's a good idea and it'll be a good reminder for the teachers as well.
[49.5s-53.8s] So one other thing I wanted to talk about, there's a student I've noticed here, John Smith.
[54.4s-57.3s] He's missed seven days already and it's only November.
[57.3s-59.7s] Does anyone have an idea what's going on with him?
[60.5s-61.8s] I might be able to fill in the gaps there.
[62.1s-64.7s] I talked to John today and he's really stressed out.
[65.0s-68.8s] He's been dealing with helping his parents take care of his younger siblings during the day.
[69.7s-73.0s] It might actually be a good idea if he spoke to the guidance counselor a little bit.
[73.6s-77.5s] I can talk to John today if you want to send him to my office after you meet with him.
[77.9s-80.0s] It's a lot to deal with for a middle schooler.
[80.8s-84.4s] Great thanks and I can help out with the family's childcare needs.
[84.4s-90.6s] I'll look for some free or low-cost resources in the community to share with John and he can share them with his family.
[91.1s-92.9s] Great. Well, some really good ideas here today.
[93.6s-97.0s] Thanks for coming and if no one has anything else, I think we can wrap up.
